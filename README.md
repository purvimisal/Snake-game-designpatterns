## SUPERHERO SNAKE

This project is a re-implementation of the classic Snake game. 
We have added extra functionalities and leveraged relevant design patterns to our game.

## How to run the game
* Install greenfoot
* Clone this [repository](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa19-202-gangofive)
* Run `project.greenfoot` inside the SnakeGame folder.

## About Game

## How we SCRUM!
* Due to implementing an agile methodology, we were able to cruise through the game development without much difficulty.
* Initially we had to brainstorm to get the initial structure of the game and decide on features. Once we did that, we setup a tasks Github project dashboard and followed them up sincerely.
* We elected a Scrum master every sprint to overlook proceedings and decide the order of execution of tasks as to avoid conflicts and dependancies.
* We set-up daily stand-up calls.
* Based on availability, we did a couple of war rooms where we sat together and hacked.
